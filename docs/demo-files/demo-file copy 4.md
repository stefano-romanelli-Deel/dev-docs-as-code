# welcome to Deel

This heading should trigger the sentence case rule because it's all lowercase.

## Get started!

This one should trigger the punctuation in headings rule.

## Don't Miss This Great Opportunity

Here weâ€™re using contractions like don't, can't, and won't.

## Acronyms in docs

This section contains acronyms like National Space Association (NASA), API, and HTTP.

Some filler text here.  
Another line with acronyms: HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Bold for emphasis

Here is wrong bold emphasis that should trigger the rule.  
But here is a correct usage: click **Settings** and then **Save** to continue.  
Also allowed: **Cancel**, **OK**, and **Next** buttons.

And one more invalid bold: super important thing you should never do.

## Bad empty line

This paragraph starts immediately after the heading, so it should trigger the empty-line rule.
