# Endpoints

## Country Guide

Hiring full-time employees across the globe is complicated, you have to comply with local laws and regulations. Our country guide endpoint lets you receive up-to-date data about hiring an employee in any given Deel-supported country. 

Learn more about the country guide in this dedicated [article](https://developer.deel.com/docs/country-guide). 

## Contract Creation

Create a contract to hire an EOR employee. 

This endpoint creates a quote as well. Once the contract is created, Deel calculates the monthly cost of hiring the employee and provides you with a quote.
