Getting started with the Onboarding API is easy:

1. Create an OAuth app.
2. Authorize users. 
3. Create candidates. 

# Create an OAuth App

Onboarding API requires an OAuth app. To get started as a partner, create an OAuth App in Deel. You can follow [this guide](https://developer.deel.com/docs/oauth2-apps) to create OAuth app in Deel. Once you create an OAuth app, follow the [OAuth - Getting Started](https://developer.deel.com/docs/getting-started-1) guide to implement OAuth in your app.

# Authorize users

Once you implement OAuth in your application, enable your users to connect Deel to your organization. 

> ðŸ“˜ Please make sure to ask for **candidates:write** scope permission. It is required to create candidates. It is also the only scope you will need for this API write access.

After retrieving the access token, you can make API calls to create candidates in Deel.
